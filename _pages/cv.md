Education
======
* Ph.D. in Electronic, Electrical and Computer Science Engineering, University of Birmingham, UK, 2022
* Master of Communication Engineering, Tianjin University, China, 2016
* Bachelor of Communication Engineering (postgraduate recommendation), Tianjin University, China, 2014

Work experience
======
* Nov. 2022: Research and development software engineer
  * 2getthere, a subsidiary of ZF group, in Utrecht, the Netherlands
  * Duties includes: 
    * Software development experience follows V-model and based on C++. Include requirements, architecture, detailed design, implementation, integration, onsite tests, analysis, maintenance and documentation of software system.

    * R&D of radar perception and hybrid multi-modal automotive sensor calibration software products for various L-4 AD vehicle projects such as [Rabus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isRtxSoPeFc) and [Rivium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5-rI5n6qng): radar dynamic object tracking, radar objects classification, end-of-line calibration, [online calibration software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mTBcsLttQY&t=35s) and [misalignment detetection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0upbUKoufw&t=191s) on automotive sensors. The industrialized radar perception product runs on the L4 AD vehicle which operate in both Germany and the Netherlands, and the calibration solutions achieved the high-accuracy calibration from production line to operation phase.

    * Experiences and systematic training of industry-safety standards and software development guidelines (e.g. ISO26262, ISO21448, ASPICE and AUTOSAR). Daily work experience in a Scrum-based agile team.

    * Theoretical knowledge and code implementation on algorithms of automotive sensor signal processing, image processing, image segmentation, geometric perception, machine learning, linear algebra and robust optimization.
  * Supervisor: Aless Lasaruk (tech lead), Dr. Emi Mathews (line manager)

* Jun. 2022: Computing technology consultant
  * Huawei Belgium NV, Leuven, Belgium
  * Duties included
    * Technical insight of high-performance computing (HPC) technology and summarize the strategic value and opportunity to computing business.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Tingyao Wu

* Summer 2015: Postdoc Researcher & Ph.D researcher
  * University of Birmingham, UK
  * Duties included: 
    * Participate in multiple autonomous driving projects collaborated with industry in the fields of cognitive vehicles, high-resolution imaging automotive radar and THz-technology.

    * Work on algorithms of end-to-end image segmentation, object detection, moving target tracking, image registration on high-resolution automotive radar images. Two full paper of IEEE Sensors Journal and four conference proceedings have been published or are under final review.

    * Theoretical study and experimental verification on automotive radar signal propagation feature on vehicle infrastructures with the innovated low-THz frequency bands. Two full papers of IEEE Sensors Journal and one conference proceedings have been published or are under final review.

    * Build the academic network. Oral presentations on more than five international radar conferences for eight times, and nominated as the best paper of Radar 2022 IET.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Marina Gashinova, Prof. Mikhail Cherniakov
