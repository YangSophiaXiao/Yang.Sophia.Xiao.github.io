After seven years of deep dive into the automotive sensor field, I received my Master's degree from Tianjin University majoring in EE in the area of LIDAR system, and PhD's degree from the University of Birmingham with extensive research conducted in the area of automotive radar. With research experiences in academia, I started the adventure in the automotive industry since I joined the subsidiary of zf group - 2getthere in 2022. I am currently working as a research and developement software engineer for the innovative software solutions for Level-4 autonomous driving vehicles, and dedicated to the software development based on C++ and industrial standards. 

My core competencies include sensor fusion, sensor calibration, object detection and tracking, automotive radar systems, low-terahertz (Low-THz) technology, image processing/segmenation, machine learning, software developement on c++ and automotive industry safety standars. I have published multiple papers in prestigious journals and conferences and obtained several certifications and honors related to machine learning, deep neural networks, software safety, matlab, C++ and data management. 

In my professional domain, I am passionate about developing innovative and robust solutions for autonomous driving and mobility. 

My up-to-date CV is available [here](../files/CV_YX.pdf).

Miscellaneous
======

In my leisure time, I enjoy discovering the small joys of daily life—whether it’s through music, cuisine, or traveling. So far, I’ve visited 20 different countries, and there’s still so much of this beautiful world waiting for me to explore. I also love spending time outdoors and playing sports with my amazing dog, Marco van Delft. Vocal music is another passion of mine; it has a special way of helping me unwind and heal from stress. Additionally, I take great pleasure in cooking Chinese dishes for my friends and family, sharing the rich traditions of Chinese cuisine with the world!
