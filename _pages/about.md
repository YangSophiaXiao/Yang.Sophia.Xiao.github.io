After nine years of deep dive into the automotive sensor field, I received my Master's degree from Tianjin University majoring in EE in the area of LIDAR system, and PhD's degree from the University of Birmingham with extensive research conducted in the area of automotive radar. With research experiences in academia, I started the adventure in the automotive industry since I joined the subsidiary of zf group - 2getthere in 2022. I am currently working as a R&D software engineer for the innovative software solutions for Level-4 autonomous driving vehicles, and dedicated to the software development based on C++ and industrial standards. 

My core competencies include sensor fusion, sensor calibration, object detection and tracking, automotive radar systems, low-terahertz (Low-THz) technology, image processing/segmenation, machine learning, software developement on c++ and automotive industry safety standars. I have published multiple papers in prestigious journals and conferences and obtained several certifications and honors related to machine learning, deep neural networks, software safety, matlab, C++ and data management. 

In my professional domain, I am passionate about developing innovative and robust solutions for autonomous driving and mobility. In my life, I love to explore all the tiny beauties in daily life - music, cuisine, and traveling.

My up-to-date CV is available [here](../files/CV_YX.pdf).

During my leisure time, I love to explore all the tiny beauties in daily life - music, cuisine, and traveling. Up till now I have been to 20 different countries and there are still way more nice wonderful world wait me to explore. I love to play and do outdoor sports with my cool dog whose name is Marco van Delft, and I love vocal music which could always heal me from all the stresses. I enjoy a lot of making Chinese cuisine for my friends and families and spreading Chinese traditonal food cultrue to the world!
