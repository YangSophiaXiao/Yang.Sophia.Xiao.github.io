excerpt: 'Abstract: This paper investigates signal attenuation through automotive bumpers at the conventional automotive radar frequency (77GHz) and at a Low-THz frequency (300 GHz). A Frequency-Modulated Continues-Wave (FMCW) radar operating at 77 GHz and a Stepped Frequency Radar (SFR) operating at 300 GHz are used in this experiment. The measured transmissivity through three bumper samples are compared at both frequencies to analyze the performance difference between the current automotive radar and prospective Low-THz radars. Transmissivity through the bumper samples show difference of around 1- 2 dB between the two frequencies under study.'
