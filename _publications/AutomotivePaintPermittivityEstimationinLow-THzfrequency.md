excerpt: 'Abstract- The propagation characteristics of radar signal through vehicle infrastructure depends on electro-physical properties of a media, in particularly complex permittivity of automotive paint. In this paper, complex permittivities of various automotive paints are measured within the range from 0.14 THz to 1.1 THz using Terahertz Vector Network Analyzer (THz- VNA). The measured complex permittivities are then used to evaluate the attenuation and reflectivity of aggregate multi-layer paint.'
