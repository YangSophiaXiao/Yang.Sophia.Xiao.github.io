excerpt: 'Abstract- Image segmentation on automotive radar imagery is the key technique for identifying the passable and impassable regions for path planning in autonomous or assistive driving. The availability of consecutive frames which measure the driving scene shifted along with the timeline enables improved segmentation on radar imagery. The frame fusion on automotive radar map is implemented as a two-step procedure: 1) The pixel-to-pixel mapping between consecutive frames is achieved based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU); 2) The information fusion of consecutive frames is achieved based on the Kalman filter. The frame fusion operation leads to correct classification of the initially ‘unknown” regions and overall improves the confidence of classification compared to single frame segmentation. The segmentation results with frame fusion are presented and compared with the results of single frame segmentation to demonstrate the segmentation improvement.'
