excerpt: 'Abstractâ€”This paper is concerned with modelling of the transmissivity of Low-Terahertz waves through automotive bumper and headlight cover material. This work is part of wider comprehensive studies on the potential for the use higher frequency bands for future automotive sensors. Theo- retical models for transmissivity prediction are described, the methodology of experimentation is discussed and experimental results are presented. The theoretical models of reflection and transmission of different base materials which are cov- ered by different layers of paint are based on Fresnel theory, and the phenomena caused by the half wavelength thickness of the medium is analyzed mathematically. The experimental verification of the models in this paper have been undertaken at 300 GHz and 670 GHz, using 77 GHz as a reference frequency.'
