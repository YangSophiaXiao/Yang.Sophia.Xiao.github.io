excerpt: 'Abstract- Full channel characterization is a vital part of research before launching new sensors for any applications. The requirement for higher image resolution close to the optical sensors while able to operate in all-weather and light conditions as well as being compact in size and light weight grows an interest for sub-THz automotive sensors. The basic step for channel characterization for outdoor application is described in this chapter. The channel characterization for sub-THz automotive radars is conducted alongside the current automotive radar frequency to provide meaningful understanding of benefit and drawbacks of increasing the frequency of operation to sub-THz region. The experimental and analytical studies in this chapter had been made with the main goal to demonstrate the feasibility of sub-THz sensing for outdoor application, in particular for automotive sensing. It has been shown that for all components of the propagation channel, the attenuation is within the acceptable range and there is no anticipated showstopper which would prevent development of sub-THz automotive sensors for future demands.'
